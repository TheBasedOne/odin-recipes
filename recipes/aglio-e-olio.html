        <h3>Description</h3>

        <P>
            No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.        </P>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of olive oil</li>
            <li>Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic</li>
            <li>Seasonings: crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Toast the garlic in olive oil.</li>
            <li>Stir the seasonings into the pasta, then stir in the garlic and oil.</li>
        </ol>
